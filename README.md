Reads Any 24bit BMP, displays the first 320x240 of image. 

**** PLEASE NOTE ALL CODE WRITTEN IN the FAT folder was written by  ChaN  @ http://elm-chan.org/ I do not take any credit for his/her 
work i recommend visiting his site for a great tutorial on the prcoess of using his fat32 and 16 libs. 



About the Application: 
  This is currently a work in progress, however if you wish to load bmps to your display please transfer all bmps to the root
  directory of the SD. Make sure the bmps are 24bit i have yet to give it the ability to read the other varaities.
